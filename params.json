{"name":"Xi Project","tagline":"a distributed agent framework for hackers","body":"### Introduction\r\n\r\nThe Xi project is a set of libraries, tools and conventions to write a distributed personal assistant. It might be good at other tasks too.\r\n\r\nTo see an example of what Xi can do, check out [Zeus](http://xiproject.github.io/zeus), the personal assistant for hackers.\r\n\r\n### Getting Started\r\n\r\nThis documentation is useful for people who want to extend Zeus, or who want to write their own distributed applications using Xi.\r\n\r\nThe Xi project consists of [Xi Core](https://github.com/xiproject/xi-core), the [Xi Agent Library](https://github.com/xiproject/xal), useful [scripts](https://github.com/xiproject/scripts) including an agent runner, and various [agents](#) written for Zeus, that you might find useful in your application.\r\n\r\nIf you are modifying Zeus, you will find all of the above in the project repository, and can make changes to that directly.\r\n\r\nIf you want to write a Xi application from scratch, you should check out the [Xi Starter](https://github.com/xiproject/xi-starter) project.\r\n\r\n### About\r\n\r\nMade by Vikrant Varma (@amrav) and Mihir Rege (@geremih).
